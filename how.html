        <p><span class="serf">I speak in binaries & oxymorons</span> (& ampersands) and think of it like this: these two things are not the edges of possibility, but two points in an expanse without borders. In the tarot, <span class="serf">Temperance is a balancing act</span>. It’s that two extremes can coexist, have to coexist, to make a whole. Temperance is neither compromise or concession, but an ebb and flow, settling into alignment. For Temperance to encompass two disparate ideas is to conjunct them, to heal a schism, to honor the past & preserve its good in a revolutionary future.</p>
        <p>I really love Temperance. I relate to its contradictions, as a theater maker and political thinker. I’m American and not, I am man & woman and mystical & rational, I have a Pisces sun & a Virgo moon, I conserve & abolish, <a href="http://www.coloursofresistance.org/572/beyond-nationalism-but-not-without-it/" class="serf" target="_blank">beyond nationalism, but not without it</a>.</p>
        <p>I tend to like linear, conventional drama, with queer people of color and set anywhere but New York. Depending on audience, I think <span class="serf">content can be radical independent of form</span>, and we have more to learn about each other than we do about theater.</p>
        <p>I write about <span class="serf">history</span> & how it haunts us, in elusive, ancestral pain & its <span class="serf">materialist conception</span>: how centuries of global capitalism have located these characters in their current conditions, however mundane or insular or provincial their daily lives seem. I like plays where nothing seems to happen. I think there is joy in the banal, life is more than suffering, and the vapid, routine things we do are worth celebration. I believe in specificity, from "get the name of the dog" to the narrative masterclass that is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB7noMnaGO8" class="serf" target="">All Too Well</a> by Taylor Swift. I write womxn who swear and scream and hurt and care for each other, who are strong only some of the time, who are too much. <span class="serf">I love realism because life contains magic</span>. I'm interested in rurality, ritual, community, epiphany, divinity.</p>
        <p>Temperance is a vessel for many things & multiple realities & is, ultimately, dialogic: <span class="serf">Temperance holds truth</span>. And I’ve pursued truth from birth, in waxing and waning faith, in <span class=serf>journalism’s first obligation is to the truth</span>, in astrology, in writing a thesis on verbatim drama, in <span class="serf">archives</span> & <span class="serf">memory</span> & myriad ways to keep record. Temperance is Yuri Kochiyama’s instruction of <span class="serf">don’t become too narrow</span>.</p>
        <p>The theater I strive for is <span class="serf">jubilant</span> and full of hope borne from loss, The Star following The Tower. I come from resilience and survival, at the twice-colonized fringes of empire and its very heart. I look at my home in Kentucky and see struggle & strength against oligarchy. I've lived two decades in the middle of America and wrenched it open to fit me and my contradictions. I write with hope because we imagine and create <span class="serf">compassionate, anarchic futures</span> to care for ourselves and each other.</p>
        <p>But then again, the <span class="serf">Uranus</span> tattooed on my arm <img src="uranus.png" class="symbol"> corresponds to The Fool.</p>
