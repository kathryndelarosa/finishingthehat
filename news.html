            <h1>Current projects</h1>
            <p>At Actors Theatre, I split my time between the mainstage and the PTC seasons. I’m assisting with dramaturgy for <em>The Wolves</em>, as well as Jeff Augustin’s <em>Where the Mountain Meets the Sea</em>, Candrice Jones’ <em>FLEX</em>, and the PTC commission <em>Are You There?</em> by Vivian Barnes, Jonathan Norton and Gab Reisman in the Humana Festival. I served as dramaturg for half of the <em>Solo Mio</em> series written and performed by acting apprentices, which played in three rounds in September and October. I’m also at the helm of the PTC New Play Project commission <em>Louisville // Kentucky // USA</em> by Lisa Sanaye Dring.</p>
            <p>In December, I found a second to workshop my play <em>Ribs</em> with University Players, culminating in a weekend of public readings at Indiana University.</p>
            <p>After graduating this May, I was a literary assistant at The New Harmony Project, where I worked on Donnetta Lavinia Grays’ <em>Where We Stand</em> and lent dramaturgical support to Jennifer Barclay and Robert Schenkkan. I got my first professional dramaturgy credit under my belt with IU Summer Theatre’s <em>Little Women</em>. </p>
