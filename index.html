        <p>Kathryn de la Rosa is a Pilipinx-Kentuckian playwright and freelance dramaturg & audio producer working onstage, online and on air. They believe access & information are tools for liberation, and write plays about radical, mystical, chaotic womxn in the middle of America.</p>
        <p>While their mother didn't let them do community theater, leave the house, or have friends, prepubescent Kathryn learned to code websites, recorded & mixed themself singing the whole Johanna Quartet from Sweeney Todd, and squeezed every morsel of theater they could from the Internet & public library. Since then, Kathryn has been a <a href="https://actorstheatre.org/bios/bios/kathryn-de-la-rosa" target="_blank">dramaturgy apprentice at Actors Theatre of Louisville</a> and interned at The New Harmony Project. Their plays have been developed at Indiana University and with some of the Professional Training Company at Actors Theatre.</p>
        <p>Kathryn writes & reports for <a href="https://queerkentucky.com" target="_blank">Queer Kentucky</a>. Their freelance work ranges from production dramaturgy to audio editing to podcast development. They hold bachelor’s degrees in theatre & drama and audio journalism from Indiana University, where they were the original <a href="https://www.idsnews.com/staff/kathryn-de-la-rosa" target="_blank">Indiana Daily Student astrologer</a>, and dramaturged, sound designed, stage managed, and performed in <a href="https://theatre.indiana.edu/about/company/d-f/de-la-rosa-kathryn.html" target="_blank">student theater</a>. Their main hobbies are <a href="https://github.com/kathryndelarosa" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and guitar.</p>

          <em>Holy Virgins</em>, full-length
          <br>it’s 2012 in western Kentucky, and Sam, Marina and Jesse are about to be licensed drivers, confirmed Catholics, and suspended from Immaculate Conception High School for a Satanic prank, a Marian hoax or on the Vatican decree against against communism, depending on who you ask. a sour-sweet dark comedy about queer girlhood, forgiving your mom, and what to believe.

            <br>“did you know spinster age is 22?” 21-year-old Liha asks her 21-year-old roommates. a sort-of sex comedy in an accidental virgin vault, <em>Ribs</em> explores femininity, sexuality, and privilege from the strange, funny, vulgar confines of a Bloomington, Indiana student rental during Colton Underwood's season of <em>The Bachelor</em>—and the highs and horrors of being a woman at a state university.

        <p>I tend to like linear, conventional drama, with queer people of color and set anywhere but New York. Depending on audience, I think content can be radical independent of form, and we have more to learn about each other than we do about theater.</p>
        <p>I write about history & how it haunts us, in elusive, ancestral pain & its materialist conception: how centuries of globalized capitalism have located these characters in their current conditions, however mundane or insular or provincial their lives seem.</p>
        <p>I like plays where nothing seems to happen. I think there is joy in the banal, life is more than suffering, and the vapid, routine things we do are worth celebration.</p>
        <p>I believe in specificity, from "get the name of the dog" to the narrative masterclass that is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB7noMnaGO8" target="_blank">All Too Well by Taylor Swift</a>.</p>
        <p>I write womxn who swear and scream and hurt and care for each other, who are strong only some of the time, who are too much.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in rurality, ritual, community, epiphany, divinity.</p>
        <p>I love realism because life contains magic.</p>
        <p>Lately, my head is full of liberation theology. Whatever decolonization means, I'm learning it's not a wholesale rejection of colonial markers, but honoring how generations remake violent images and ideas for revolution.</p>
        <p>The theater I strive for is jubilant and full of hope borne from loss, The Star following The Tower. I come from resilience and survival, at the twice-colonized margins of empire and its very heart. I look at my home in Kentucky and see struggle & strength against oligarchy. I write with hope because we imagine & create compassionate, anarchic futures to care for ourselves and each other.</p>
