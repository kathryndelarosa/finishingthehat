            <span class="wee"><em>this is my diversity statement</em> — 7f + 3m, full-length</span>
            <p>When a racist incident at an arts summer camp forces eight college-aged counselors to do damage control, what's right? What's true? Who constructs safe space, and at whose cost? On liberalism, the non-profit sector, and TikTok teens.</p>
            
            <span class="wee"><em>Ribs</em> — 4f, full-length</span>
            <p>"Did you know spinster age is 22?” 21-year-old Liha asks her 21-year-old roommates. A sort-of sex comedy in an accidental virgin vault, <em>Ribs</em> explores femininity, sexuality, and privilege from the strange, funny, vulgar confines of a Bloomington student rental — and the highs and horrors of being a woman at a state university.</p>
            
            <span class="wee"><em>Pasyon Play</em> — 3f + 8m, one-act</span>
            <p>In the Philippines, 1970, a man asks to be crucified. A family at the heart of staging Christ's death grapples with transformation: changing players, postcolonial politics, and penance. After Sarah Ruhl.</p>
            
            <span class="wee"><em>Holy Virgins</em> — 3f + 1nb, one-act</span>
            <p>Sam, Marina and Lenny bail on Confirmation class after a Satanic prank gone awry.</p>
            
            <span class="wee"><em>first love / late spring</em> — 2, one-act</span>
            <p>They meet in autumn, fall in winter, and leave in spring. A selfish millennial pandemic non-breakup play.</p>
